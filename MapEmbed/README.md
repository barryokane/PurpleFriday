# Build instructions

Make sure you have node installed. Go into the `./MapEmbed` directory and run

```
npm i
```

This will install all dependencies that you need. To get a build of `./src` into `./public` run

```
npm run build
```

To do some local dev/testing run

```
npm run deb
```

That will start a simple server with `livereload` on port 9000
